INSERT INTO `posts` VALUES (7,'History','The term \"weblog\" was coined by Jorn Barger[9] on December 17, 1997. The short form, \"blog\", was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase we blog in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999.[10][11][12] Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used \"blog\" as both a noun and verb (\"to blog\", meaning \"to edit one\'s weblog or to post to one\'s weblog\") and devised the term \"blogger\" in connection with Pyra Labs\' Blogger product, leading to the popularization of the terms.','2021-03-30 11:30:30','History','home-bg.jpg','History'),(8,'Popularity','As of 2008, blogging had become such a mania that a new blog was created every second of every minute of every hour of every day. Researchers have actively analyzed the dynamics of how blogs become popular. There are essentially two measures of this: popularity through citations, as well as popularity through affiliation (i.e., blogroll). The basic conclusion from studies of the structure of blogs is that while it takes time for a blog to become popular through blogrolls, permalinks can boost popularity more quickly, and are perhaps more indicative of popularity and authority than blogrolls, since they denote that people are actually reading the blog\'s content and deem it valuable or noteworthy in specific cases.\r\n\r\nThe blogdex project was launched by researchers in the MIT Media Lab to crawl the Web and gather data from thousands of blogs to investigate their social properties. Information was gathered by the tool for over four years, during which it autonomously tracked the most contagious information spreading in the blog community, ranking it by recency and popularity. It can, therefore,[original research?] be considered the first instantiation of a memetracker. The project was replaced by tailrank.com which in turn has been replaced by spinn3r.com.\r\n\r\nBlogs are given rankings by Alexa Internet (web hits of Alexa Toolbar users), and formerly by blog search engine Technorati based on the number of incoming links (Technorati stopped doing this in 2014). In August 2006, Technorati found that the most linked-to blog on the internet was that of Chinese actress Xu Jinglei. Chinese media Xinhua reported that this blog received more than 50 million page views, claiming it to be the most popular blog in the world. Technorati rated Boing Boing to be the most-read group-written blog.\r\n\r\n','2021-03-30 10:20:07','Popularity','about-bg.jpg',NULL),(10,'Blurring with the mass media','As of 2008, blogging had become such a mania that a new blog was created every second of every minute of every hour of every day.[48] Researchers have actively analyzed the dynamics of how blogs become popular.

Among the various forms of advertising on blog, the most controversial are the sponsored posts.[57] These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback, reviews, opinion, videos, etc. and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword or several keywords. Blogs have led to some disintermediation and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model, where companies can skip over the advertising agencies (previously the only interface with the customer) and contact the customers directly via social media websites. On the other hand, new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established, to take advantage of this new development as well. However, there are many people who look negatively on this new development. Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogosphere\'s credibility','2021-03-30 11:05:26','Consumer','about-bg.jpg',NULL),(12,'Legal and social consequences','Several cases have been brought before the national courts against bloggers concerning issues of defamation or liability. U.S. payouts related to blogging totaled $17.4 million by 2009; in some cases these have been covered by umbrella insurance.[60] The courts have returned with mixed verdicts. Internet Service Providers (ISPs), in general, are immune from liability for information that originates with third parties (U.S. Communications Decency Act and the EU Directive 2000/31/EC). In Doe v. Cahill, the Delaware Supreme Court held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask the anonymous bloggers, and also took the unusual step of dismissing the libel case itself (as unfounded under American libel law) rather than referring it back to the trial court for reconsideration.[61] In a bizarre twist, the Cahills were able to obtain the identity of John Doe, who turned out to be the person they suspected: the town\'s mayor, Councilman Cahill\'s political rival. The Cahills amended their original complaint, and the mayor settled the case rather than going to trial.\r\n\r\nIn January 2007, two prominent Malaysian political bloggers, Jeff Ooi and Ahirudin Attan, were sued by a pro-government newspaper, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad, Kalimullah bin Masheerul Hassan, Hishamuddin bin Aun and Brenden John a/l John Pereira over an alleged defamation. The plaintiff was supported by the Malaysian government.[62] Following the suit, the Malaysian government proposed to \"register\" all bloggers in Malaysia to better control parties against their interest.[63] This is the first such legal case against bloggers in the country. In the United States, blogger Aaron Wall was sued by Traffic Power for defamation and publication of trade secrets in 2005.[64] According to Wired magazine, Traffic Power had been \"banned from Google for allegedly rigging search engine results.\"[65] Wall and other \"white hat\" search engine optimization consultants had exposed Traffic Power in what they claim was an effort to protect the public. The case was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, and Traffic Power failed to appeal within the allowed time.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, NDTV issued a legal notice to Indian blogger Kunte for a blog post criticizing their coverage of the Mumbai attacks.[67] The blogger unconditionally withdrew his post, which resulted in several Indian bloggers criticizing NDTV for trying to silence critics.','2021-03-30 11:07:58','Defamation or liability','about-bg.jpg',NULL),(13,'Employment','In general, attempts by employee bloggers to protect themselves by maintaining anonymity have proved ineffective.[69] In 2009, a controversial and landmark decision by The Hon. Mr Justice Eady refused to grant an order to protect the anonymity of Richard Horton. Horton was a police officer in the United Kingdom who blogged about his job under the name \"NightJack\".[70]\r\n\r\nDelta Air Lines fired flight attendant Ellen Simonetti because she posted photographs of herself in uniform on an airplane and because of comments posted on her blog \"Queen of Sky: Diary of a Flight Attendant\" which the employer deemed inappropriate.[71][72] This case highlighted the issue of personal blogging and freedom of expression versus employer rights and responsibilities, and so it received wide media attention. Simonetti took legal action against the airline for \"wrongful termination, defamation of character and lost future wages\".[73] The suit was postponed while Delta was in bankruptcy proceedings.[74]\r\n\r\nIn early 2006, Erik Ringmar, a senior lecturer at the London School of Economics, was ordered by the convenor of his department to \"take down and destroy\" his blog in which he discussed the quality of education at the school.[75]\r\n\r\nMark Jen was terminated in 2005 after 10 days of employment as an assistant product manager at Google for discussing corporate secrets on his personal blog, then called 99zeros and hosted on the Google-owned Blogger service.[76] He blogged about unreleased products and company finances a week before the company\'s earnings announcement. He was fired two days after he complied with his employer\'s request to remove the sensitive material from his blog.[77]\r\n\r\nIn India, blogger Gaurav Sabnis resigned from IBM after his posts questioned the claims made by a management school.[78] Jessica Cutler, aka \"The Washingtonienne\", blogged about her sex life while employed as a congressional assistant. After the blog was discovered and she was fired,[79] she wrote a novel based on her experiences and blog: The Washingtonienne: A Novel. As of 2006, Cutler is being sued by one of her former lovers in a case that could establish the extent to which bloggers are obligated to protect the privacy of their real life associates.[80]\r\n\r\nCatherine Sanderson, a.k.a. Petite Anglaise, lost her job in Paris at a British accountancy firm because of blogging.[81] Although given in the blog in a fairly anonymous manner, some of the descriptions of the firm and some of its people were less than flattering. Sanderson later won a compensation claim case against the British firm, however.[82]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Penelope Trunk wrote an upbeat article in The Boston Globe in 2006, entitled \"Blogs \'essential\' to a good career\".[83] She was one of the first journalists to point out that a large portion of bloggers are professionals and that a well-written blog can help attract employers.\r\n\r\n','2021-03-30 11:08:48','Employment','login.jpg',NULL),(14,'Political dangers','Blogging can sometimes have unforeseen consequences in politically sensitive areas. In some countries, Internet police or secret police may monitor blogs and arrest blog authors of commentators. Blogs can be much harder to control than broadcast or print media, because a person can create a blog whose authorship is hard to trace, by using anonymity technology such as Tor. As a result, totalitarian and authoritarian regimes often seek to suppress blogs and/or to punish those who maintain them.\r\n\r\nIn Singapore, two ethnic Chinese individuals were imprisoned under the country\'s anti-sedition law for posting anti-Muslim remarks in their blogs.[85] Egyptian blogger Kareem Amer was charged with insulting the Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and an Islamic institution through his blog. It is the first time in the history of Egypt that a blogger was prosecuted. After a brief trial session that took place in Alexandria, the blogger was found guilty and sentenced to prison terms of three years for insulting Islam and inciting sedition, and one year for insulting Mubarak.[86] Egyptian blogger Abdel Monem Mahmoud was arrested in April 2007 for anti-government writings in his blog. Monem is a member of the then banned Muslim Brotherhood. After the 2011 Egyptian revolution, the Egyptian blogger Maikel Nabil Sanad was charged with insulting the military for an article he wrote on his personal blog and sentenced to 3 years.[87]\r\n\r\nAfter expressing opinions in his personal blog about the state of the Sudanese armed forces, Jan Pronk, United Nations Special Representative for the Sudan, was given three days notice to leave Sudan. The Sudanese army had demanded his deportation.[88][89] In Myanmar, Nay Phone Latt, a blogger, was sentenced to 20 years in jail for posting a cartoon critical of head of state Than Shwe.','2021-03-30 11:10:22','Political dangers','login.jpg',NULL),(15,'Personal safety','One consequence of blogging is the possibility of online or in-person attacks or threats against the blogger, sometimes without apparent reason. In some cases, bloggers have faced cyberbullying. Kathy Sierra, author of the blog \"Creating Passionate Users\",[91] was the target of threats and misogynistic insults to the point that she canceled her keynote speech at a technology conference in San Diego, fearing for her safety.[92] While a blogger\'s anonymity is often tenuous, Internet trolls who would attack a blogger with threats or insults can be emboldened by the anonymity of the online environment, where some users are known only by a pseudonymous \"username\" (e.g., \"Hacker1984\"). Sierra and supporters initiated an online discussion aimed at countering abusive online behavior[93] and developed a Blogger\'s Code of Conduct, which set out a rules for behaviour in the online space.','2021-03-30 11:10:51','Personal safety','',NULL),(16,'Marketing value','Customer engagement marketing is necessitated by a combination of social, technological and market developments. Companies attempt to create an engaging dialogue with target consumers and stimulate their engagement with the given brand. Although this must take place both on and off-line, the internet is considered the primary method. Marketing begins with understanding the internal dynamics of these developments and the behaviour and engagement of consumers online. Consumer-generated media plays a significant role in the understanding and modeling of engagement.[19] The control Web 2.0 consumers have gained is quantified through \'old school\' marketing performance metrics.[20]\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of the traditional \'interrupt and repeat\' model of advertising is decreasing, which has caused businesses to lose control of communications agendas.[21][22][23][24] In August 2006, McKinsey & Co published a report[25] which indicated that traditional TV advertising would decrease in effectiveness compared to previous decades.[21] As customer audiences have become smaller and more specialised, the fragmentation of media, audiences and the accompanying reduction of audience size[21] have reduced the effectiveness of the traditional top-down, mass, \'interrupt and repeat\' advertising model. A Forrester Research\'s North American Consumer Technology Adoption Study[25] found that people in the 18-26 age group spend more time online than watching TV.[6][21]\r\n\r\nIn response to the fragmentation and increased amount of time spent online, marketers have also increased spending in online communication. ContextWeb analysts found marketers who promote on sites like Facebook and New York Times are not as successful at reaching consumers while marketers who promote more on niche websites have a better chance of reaching their audiences.[26] Customer audiences are also broadcasters with the power for circulation and permanence of CGM, businesses lose influence. Rather than trying to position a product using static messages, companies can become the subject of conversation amongst a target market that has already discussed, positioned and rated the product. This also means that consumers can now choose not only when and how but, also, if they will engage with marketing communications.[6] In addition, new media provides consumers with more control over advertising consumption.[27]','2021-03-30 11:11:50','Marketing value ','',NULL),(17,'Consumer behaviour','CE behaviour became prominent with the advent of the social phenomenon of online CE. Creating and stimulating customer engagement behaviour has recently become an explicit aim of both profit and non-profit organisations in the belief that engaging target customers to a high degree is conducive to furthering business objectives.\r\n\r\nShevlin\'s definition of CE is well suited to understanding the process that leads to an engaged customer. In its adaptation by Richard Sedley the key word is \'investment\'.\"Repeated interactions that strengthen the emotional, psychological or physical investment a customer has in a brand.\"\r\n\r\nA customer\'s degree of engagement with a company lies in a continuum that represents the strength of his investment in that company. Positive experiences with the company strengthen that investment and move the customer down the line of engagement.\r\n\r\nWhat is important in measuring degrees of involvement is the ability of defining and quantifying the stages on the continuum. One popular suggestion is a four-level model adapted from Kirkpatrick\'s Levels:\r\n\r\nClick - A reader arrived (current metric)\r\nConsume - A reader read the content\r\nUnderstood - A reader understood the content and remembers it\r\nApplied - A reader applies the content in another venue\r\nConcerns have, however, been expressed as regards the measurability of stages three and four. Another popular suggestion is Ghuneim\'s typology of engagement.[30]\r\n\r\nDegrees of engagement	Low	Medium	High	Highest\r\nAdoption	Collaborative Filtering	Content Creation	Social\r\nBookmarking, Tagging, Adding to the group	Rating, Voting, Commenting, Endorsing, Favouritising	Upload (User Generated Content), Blogging, Fan community participation, Create mash-ups, Podcasting, Vlogging	Adding Friends, Networking, Create Fan Community\r\nThe following consumer typology according to degree of engagement fits also into Ghuneim\'s continuum: Creators (smallest group), Critics, Collectors, Couch Potatoes (largest group).[31]\r\n\r\nEngagement is a holistic characterization of a consumer\'s behavior, encompassing a host of sub-aspects of behaviour such as loyalty, satisfaction, involvement, Word of Mouth advertising, complaining and more.\r\n\r\nSatisfaction: Satisfaction is simply the foundation, and the minimum requirement, for a continuing relationship with customers. Engagement extends beyond mere satisfaction.\r\nLoyalty - Retention: Highly engaged consumers are more loyal. Increasing the engagement of target customers increases the rate of customer retention.\r\nWord of Mouth advertising - advocacy: Highly engaged customers are more likely to engage in free (for the company), credible (for their audience) Word of Mouth advertising. This can drive new customer acquisition and can have viral effects.\r\nAwareness - Effectiveness of communications: When customers are exposed to communication from a company that they are highly engaged with, they tend to actively elaborate on its central idea. This brings about high degrees of central processing and recall.[27]\r\nFiltering: Consumers filter, categorize and rate the market from head to tail, creating multiple, overlapping folksonomies through tagging, reviewing, rating and recommending.\r\nComplaint-behaviour: Highly engaged customers are less likely to complain to other current or potential customers, but will address the company directly instead.\r\nMarketing intelligence: Highly engaged customers can give valuable recommendations for improving the quality of the offering.\r\nThe behavioural outcomes of an engaged consumer are what links CE to profits. From this point of view,\r\n\r\n\"CE is the best measure of current and future performance; an engaged relationship is probably the only guarantee for a return on your organization\'s or your clients\' objectives.\"[32] Simply attaining a high level of customer satisfaction does not seem to guarantee the customer\'s business. 60% to 80% of customers who defect to a competitor said they were satisfied or very satisfied on the survey just prior to their defection.[6]:32\r\n\r\nThe main difference between traditional and customer engagement marketing is marked by these shifts:\r\n\r\nFrom \'reach or awareness focused\' marketing communications and their metrics (GRP or pageview) towards more targeted and customised interactions that prompt the consumer to engage with and act on the content from the outset.\r\nFrom absolute distinctions and barriers between an organisation and its target customers towards the participation of consumers in product development, customer service and other aspects of the brand experience.\r\nFrom one-way, top-down, formal B2C and B2E interaction to continuing, dialogic, decentralised and personalised communications initiated by either party.\r\nSpecific marketing practices involve:\r\n\r\nEncouraging collaborative filtering: Google, Amazon, iTunes, Yahoo LAUNCHcast, Netflix, and Rhapsody encourage their consumers to filter, categorise and rate; that is, to market their products. They realise consumers are not only much more adept at creating highly targeted taxonomies (folksonomies) given that they are more adept at delineating the segment they themselves constitute, but, also, that they are willing to do so for free. And to the extent they cannot, they do it for them. If enough people like the band Groove Armada as well as the band The Crystal Method, there may well be a stylistic connection between them, despite the fact that one\'s categorised as \'downtempo\' and the other \'beats and breaks\'. Such strong associations tell Yahoo! to put the two on the same playlist more often, and if the positive ratings continue to come in, that connection is reinforced.[21]:101 Amazon does the same with their ‘customers who bought this item also bought…’ recommendations.\r\nCommunity development: Helping target customers develop their own communities or create new ones.\r\nCommunity participation: (See Communal marketing) Consumers do not filter and rate companies and their offerings within company websites only. Being able, with little effort, cost or technical skills, to create their own online localities, a large percentage of the filtering and rating takes place in non-sponsored, online spaces. Organisations must go and meet their target customers at their favoured online hangouts to not only listen but also participate in the dialogue.\r\nHelp consumers engage with one another: Give them content (viral podcasting, videocasting, games, v-cards etc.) they can use to engage with one another.\r\nSolicitation of user generated content: Engage them directly or indirectly with your product by giving them the means or incentive to create user generated content.\r\nCustomer self-service: Help them create a customer service FAQ in wiki or blog format. Create a blog where technical support staff and customers can communicate directly.\r\nProduct co-development: Create a blog where product developers and consumers can communicate directly.\r\nLeading by teaching: Help customers in product selection by first teaching them practically, showing them a video about product use and then help them to select the product.','2021-03-30 11:12:38','Consumer behaviour','',NULL);
